    "Nuclear fusion means the fusing of two atomic nuclei. Depending on the reaction\\, large amounts of energy can be released. Nuclear fusions\\, in which energy is released\\, take place in the form of chain reactions. They are the source of the energy of the stars\\, including our sun\\, for example. A fusion reactor converts the energy released during controlled nuclear fusion into electricity.\n"..

    "A fusion reactor works according to the classic principle of a thermal power plant: water is heated and drives a steam turbine\\, whose kinetic energy is converted into electricity by a generator.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "A fusion power plant initially requires a large amount of energy\\, since a plasma has to be generated. \"Plasma\" is the name given to the fourth state of matter\\, after solid\\, liquid and gaseous. This requires a lot of electricity. Only through this extreme concentration of energy does the fusion reaction ignite and the heat given off is used to generate electricity via the heat exchanger. The generator then delivers 800 ku of electricity.\n"..

    "There are two types of magnets\\, so all sides of the magnet that face the plasma ring can also be protected with a heat shield.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "With the corner magnets on the inside of the ring\\, one connection side is covered (power or cooling) and can therefore not be connected. This is technically not feasible and therefore has no influence on the function of the fusion reactor. \n"..

    "Note: The TA5 Heat Exchanger has two connections (blue and green) for the cooling circuit. The heat exchanger and all magnets must be connected to form a cooling circuit via the green and blue pipes.\n"..
