    "  - a lighter block ('techage:lighter')\n"..
    "  - 26 wooden blocks that are stacked into a pile of wood. The type of wood is irrelevant\n"..

    "\n"..
    "  - Build a 5x5 area of dirt\n"..
    "  - Place 7 wood around the lighter but leave a hole to the lighter\n"..
    "  - Build another 2 layers of wood on top\\, making a 3x3x3 wooden cube\n"..
    "  - Cover everything with a layer of dirt into a 5x5x5 cube\\, but keep the hole to the lighter open\n"..
    "  - Light the lighter and immediately close the hole with a block of wood and dirt\n"..
